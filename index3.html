    <h3>Pizzagate: From Rumor to Delusion</h3>
    <p class="tx_1">Warren Neidich ,2019</p>
    <br>
    <p id="tx_2">Pizzagate was the fake news story that was circulated at the end of the 2016 presidential 
        campaign which accused Hillary Clinton and her staff of running a child sex slave ring out of the 
        basement of the Comet Ping Pong pizza parlor in Washington D.C.

        Many political scientists refer to our times as the post-truth moment because 
        of the difficulty in discerning whether news stories reflect the truth or not. 
        Neidich asks the question as to whether and to what degree sensationalized fictive 
        news stories command our attention and collective behavior. Do they do so more intensely than factual ones? 
        What role does art play in finding the answers?
        </p>
         <p id="tx_3">“We have now entered into a new era some have called the post-truth society characterized by a deluge of fictive mediated stories dubbed Fake News. One of these stories, Pizzagate concerns the conspiracy theory, circulated at the end of the Trump-Clinton presidential election, that accused Hillary Clinton and other members of her Democratic election committee of running a childhood sex ring in the basement of Comet Ping Pong pizza restaurant. As preposterous as this is, many people believed it and the story went viral.”

            These constitute the core issues at play in this exhibition dominated by the Pizzagate Neon, 2017, a monumental multicolored text-based neon sculpture suspended from the ceiling of the front chamber of the exhibition space. Its composition evokes both the iCloud and the connectome, a network-based model of the brain’s dynamic connection pattern.
            The sculpture will be accompanied by other works such as the experimental video entitled, Pizzagate: From Rumor to Delusion, 2019 and a performative sculpture, Scoring the Tweets, 2018.Using Internet news streams and raw footage filmed at the Comet Ping Pong, the video acts as a soundtrack in dialogue with the sculpture.
            <br>
            <br>
        Assembled together, these works begin to unravel the complex cultural, political and economic dynamics that define the mediated mass hysteria of American life today.
