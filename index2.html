    <h3>The Sprawl—Propaganda <br>about Propaganda</h3>
    <p class="tx_1">Metahaven, 2016</p>
    <br>
    <p id="tx_2">The philosopher Jacques Ellul once wrote that “nothing is worse
        in times of danger than to live in a dream world.” But he added that
        “propaganda is a good deal less the political weapon of a regime ...
        than the effect of a technological society that embraces the entire
        man.” Propaganda overlays reality with an interface that dominates
        and kills what it was supposed to mediate.
     <br>
     <br>
     Propaganda is an art that undermines through a process of
     endless seeking. It is an extreme sport, like bungee jumping off the
     high-rises of reality itself, and pursued for its own sake. The quest
     isn’t linked to a wish for clarity. On the contrary, it aspires to a spiritual admission of the human condition. People with power first act
     as gods, hiding some facts and exaggerating others. Then they retreat
     to their mere humanity and claim that no one can know
     <br>
     <br>
    Metahaven describe their new film The Sprawl as
    “propaganda about propaganda”–a mutable work
    that examines the effect of new networked communication technologies on the state’s public persuasion
    and diplomacy. The project is a continuation of their
    ongoing research addressing the negotiations and
    pitfalls of modern democracy given the rise of mass
    surveillance, big data, and cloud-based computing. 
    </p>
    <p id="tx_3">"I used to think that propaganda was about persuading people. (...)<br>Now it doesn’t seem to be about that. It’s just about deconstructing the other side, disrupting Western narratives, of any sort. There’s a steady stream of disinformation whose purpose seems to be to sort of undermine the very idea that truth is provable.”
    <p id="tx_2">  Speculative in nature, their larger body of work occupies a recognizable present and a near future, where
    traditional understandings of the nation state become
    complicated by the multiple identities, allegiances,
    and lines of communication ushered in by new
    technologies. The Sprawl exists in a similar temporal space that is
    both immediate and prognostic. While it focuses on
    mediated representations of current events such as
    the Ebola outbreak, the conflict between the Ukraine
    and Russia, and the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS), the
    film’s heavily stylized interludes cut through, gesturing
    toward an anonymous subject on the other side of
    the screen. Hovering in a ghostly parallel reality, the
    figures in these clips wield swords or stand transfixed
    by screens.
     <br>
     <br>
    Designed as a full-length feature and as something to be spliced into
    short clips that can be uploaded and distributed via
    different platforms, traveling on the very networks it
    describes, the project opens itself up to variations that
    are indeed sprawling in nature.
     <br>
     <br>
    A text in the film proclaims: “nothing can be hidden
    forever.” Propaganda operates in this great wide-open
    space, a major theme of the project. The Sprawl signals not only the mutation of state influence in the age of social media and an unprecedented
    volume of images, but also alerts us to the status of sovereignty and citizenship under a new paradigm.
