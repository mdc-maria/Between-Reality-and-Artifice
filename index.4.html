    <p id="tx_3">"Our reality is defined, in part, by a propaganda struggle. “Propaganda” here should not be understood as a singular term, since this propaganda struggle results from various competing propagandas in the plural. Various performances of power each aim to construct reality according to their interests, resulting in overlapping claims that shape the arena of the contemporary."

        This publication documents the work of propagandist and propaganda artist 
        Steve Bannon. Simultaneously, it describes the various political movements 
        that Bannon has helped to shape and which, in turn, have shaped him. 
        Tracing Bannon’s career means tracing the development of thepaleoconservative 
        factions of the Republican Party in the early 2000s, the rise of the Tea Party 
        after the election of Obama, Trumpism, and the international alternative-right. 
        Through Bannon’s work as a propaganda artist, we can come to understand that these 
        various formations are not only political but also cultural in nature.

        Propaganda demands infrastructure and narrative. The former insists that one 
        needs to gain control over the means through which society is organized, ranging 
        from the field of politics, the economy, the military-industrial complex, education, 
        and culture. Propaganda is not concerned with merely communicating a message through 
        a single poster or film —propaganda aims to construct reality itself. And in order to 
        construct reality a particular narrative, a set of values and ideas, has to be repeated 
        via as many channels as possible so as to generate its acceptance as the “new normal.” 
        <br>
        <br>
        Propaganda works best when we no longer consider it propaganda, but rather as a mere fact of life.To construct reality one needs to govern the means of production of reality. But one also needs a narrative to structure this reality effectively. This is where Bannon’s work as a propaganda artist comes in particularly in the form of his various pamphletic documentary films, but also in the realm of architecture through his involvement as the choreographer of the Trump campaign. 
        <br>
        <br>

        The aim of the exhibition-project Steve Bannon: A Propaganda Retrospective and its accompanying publication is to understand the mechanisms of propaganda and propaganda art today, taking Bannon and his contribution to the rise of Trumpism as a case study. The project aims to show how infrastructure and narrative are crucial tools in the construction of a reality that aligns with the interests of dominant forms of power, and which has terrible human costs as a result.
         Democracy was never free from propaganda and the post-truth era of alternative facts and fake news now makes this clear to us. Authoritarianism and forms of “democratic fascism” or “elected dictatorships” operate frighteningly easily within the makeup of our present societies. 
         <br>
         <br>
         The exhibition proposes to unpack the design of images, the formation of visual vocabularies, the establishment of virtual environments, and the construction of scenographies through which Trumpism has conveyed messages of hate and
polarization.
