    <p id="tx_3">We live in a post-digital era, where reality and fiction often become indistinguishable: the evidence of digital in everyday life makes it almost impossible to distinguish it from what is not digital.

        This indistinction, enhanced by the various media and emerging technologies, has not only enabled artistic, creative, and playful practices but has often been instrumentalized by power structures, threatening values such as democracy and truth in an era governed by post-truth.
        
        Within this context in a time when images offer conviction to the logic of reality, is seeing still believing?
        
        Focusing both on post-digital, post-truth, Between Reality and Artifice: The Politics of Fabricated Lies, seeks to provide an entry point into the life of our current digital condition and how its developments—since photoshoop to artifical intelligence— brought even more potent challenges to reality and the truth.</p>
