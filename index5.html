    <p id="tx_3">We live in a post-digital era, where reality and fiction often become indistinguishable: the evidence of digital in everyday life makes it almost impossible to distinguish it from what is not digital.
 This indistinction has not only enabled artistic, creative, and playful practices but has also been instrumentalized by power structures, threatening values such as truth and democracy.
Within this context in a time when images offer conviction to the logic of reality, is seeing still believing?
<br>
<br>
Focusing both on post-digital and post-truth, <span id="roman-italic">Between Reality and Artifice</span>, seeks to provide an entry point into the life of our current digital condition and how its developments brought even more potent challenges to the sense of reality, in an era governed by post-truth.</i>
<br>
<br>
The project is presented in two complementary formats: the main artifact—a print publication—with mainly theorical content and this website that works as expansion of the theme, addressing the projectual practices presented in the print publication.
